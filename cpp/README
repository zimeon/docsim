Docsim C++ code
===============

Installing
----------

The C++ code in directory ccp and under was developed with gcc 4.1.2 and 
gcc 4.4.5. Support for the evolving STL is different with GCC pre and post-4.3.
The default is set for GCC >= 4.3 and compilation should be simply a matter
of:

> cd cpp
> make

For GCC < 4.3, edit cpp/Makefile to set CPPDEFS = -D__NO_TR1__ which will
then compile with <hash_set> and <hash_map> instead of the newer
<tr1/unordered_set> and <tr1/unordered_map>. Under old GCC the head
lib/hash_ull.h is also required to provide support for unsigned long long
hashes.


Compiled successfully with:
2011-04-15: gcc4.1.2 x86-64 with -D__NO_TR1__
2011-04-15: gcc4.4.5


gSOAP library
-------------

The code assumes that gsoap 2.7.x will be installed in /opt/gsoap-2.7. To change 
this location, edit cpp/soap-server/Makefile.

On Debian and derivative systems (e.g. Ubuntu) this should be
available for etch and later distributions via apt. Install with, e.g.

sudo apt-get install gsoap

In March 2007 the current version on etch was 2.7.6 which was fine and
apt installed it in /usr/lib.

For other systems, try sourceforge:
