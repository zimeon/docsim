docsim -- Document similarity programs
======================================


Sentence and file based analysis
--------------------------------

This code may be run either ignoring linebreaks in input text files and 
treating the whole input file as one sentence. or respecting linebreaks 
in the input files as indicating sentences (as for [SOROKINA+07]). The 
default is to treat input files as a whole, ignoring sentence 
boundaries.

To select respecting sentences use the -S option for docsim-analyze, 
docsim-compare, and overlapd. Note that you will probably get odd 
results if there is mismatch in respect for sentences or not between 
analysis and comparison.

Treating files as a whole means that lib/files.cpp needs a buffer that
can read in a complete input file. The buffer size is controlled in
lib/definitions.h:

#define FILE_BUFFER_SIZE 5000000

As of 2011-02-16 the maximum psv file size for arXiv is ~4.1MB so a 
buffer size larger than this is required to treat all files whole.


Compilation
-----------

The C++ code in directory ccp and under was developed with gcc 4.1.2.
It compiles with gcc 4.4 but throws some deprecated header warnings. 
[2011-03-03]

To compile:

> cd cpp
> make


gSOAP library
-------------

On Debian and derivative systems (e.g. Ubuntu) this should be
available for etch and later distributions via apt. Install with, e.g.

sudo apt-get install gsoap

In March 2007 the current version on etch was 2.7.6 which was fine and
apt installed it in /usr/lib.

For other systems, try sourceforge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/


Testing
-------

For a simple test run with data supplied:

./docsim-analyze -d testdata/arxiv-cs-500 -f testdata/arxiv-cs-500/files.txt -b 20
./docsim-compare -f testdata/arxiv-cs-500/cs/9912/9912018.psv -b 20 -T /tmp/allkeys
